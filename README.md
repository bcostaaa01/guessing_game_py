# 🔢 Number Guessing Game 

This is a Number Guessing Game in Python, where the player has to guess a secret number within a limited number of attempts.

### ⚙️ Code design

- The secret number is stored in the code as `secret_number = 10`. 

- You can change the value to make the game harder or easier.

🔍 The number of attempts is set to `attempt_limit = 3`. You can change this value to increase or decrease the difficulty of the game.

### 🚀 Playing the game

To start playing the game, simply clone or download the repository and run the code in a Python environment. The code is located in the `number_guessing_game.py` file. 

### 🧮 Game logic

🤔 If your guess is incorrect, you will be prompted to try again until you reach the attempt limit.

🏆 If you guess the secret number correctly within the attempt limit, you win the game! 🎉

😞 If you exceed the attempt limit without guessing the correct number, you lose the game. Better luck next time!
